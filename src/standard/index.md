# Code Standards

In the process of front-end development, code standardization not only helps improve code readability and maintainability but also reduces friction in team collaboration and enhances development efficiency. This standard aims to provide a unified set of guidelines for front-end development, covering aspects such as code formatting checks, naming conventions, Vue writing standards, and TypeScript writing standards.

By adhering to this standard, developers can ensure code consistency, reduce code review issues caused by style differences, and benefit greatly in the long-term maintenance of the project. We hope this standard can provide strong support and guidance for your development work.
