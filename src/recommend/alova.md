In addition, you can use it in client and server environments (including SSR).

In addition, alova also has the following features:
- API design similar to axios, with lower learning cost;
- High-performance client and server request strategies, making the application smoother;
- High flexibility, alova can be used in any js environment with any UI framework, and provides a unified user experience and perfect code migration;
